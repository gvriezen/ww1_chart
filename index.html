<h3> A major codifying act that incorporated and consolidated earlier legislation:

    Required aliens to declare intention of permanent or temporary stay in the United States and officially classified arriving aliens as immigrants and nonimmigrants, respectively.
    Increased the head tax to $4.00 (established by the Act of August 3, 1882 and raised subsequently).
    Added to the excludable classes imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, persons with physical or mental defects which may affect their ability to earn a living, persons afflicted with tuberculosis, children unaccompanied by their parents, persons who admitted the commission of a crime involving moral turpitude, and women coming to the United States for immoral purposes.
    Exempted from the provisions of the contract labor law professional actors, artists, singers, ministers, professors, and domestic servants.
    Extended from two to three years after entry authority to deport an alien who had become a public charge from causes which existed before the alien’s entry.
    Authorized the President to refuse admission to certain persons when he was satisfied that their immigration was detrimental to labor conditions in the United States. This was aimed mainly at Japanese laborers.
    Created a Joint Commission on Immigration to make an investigation of the immigration system in the United States. The findings of this Commission were the basis for the comprehensive Immigration Act of 1917.
    Reaffirmed the requirement for manifesting of aliens arriving by water and added a like requirement with regard to departing aliens.
